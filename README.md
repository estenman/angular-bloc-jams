# bloc-jams-angular

The goal of this project was to build a music player application using Angular. This application is meant to be basic with only one album being used to demonstrate the display and functionality capabilities. However, additional albums and music files could easily be added. The site has the following functionality:

* Shows collections of all albums, as well as individual album and song information
* Has a profile page for users
* Can play, pause and skip to specific places in a song
* Automatically plays the next song when the current one is finished
* Ability to skip to the next song or go back to the previous
* Able to see a songs playback progress
* You can adjust the volume
